# Occupancy-Detection-using-various-Machine-Learning-Classification-Techniques
The accuracy of the prediction of occupancy in an office room using data from light, temperature, humidity and CO2 sensors has been 
evaluated with different Machine Learning classification algorithms implemented on python.Three data sets were used in this work, one for
training, and two for testing the models considering the office door opened and closed during occupancy. Typically the best accuracies 
are obtained from training Linear SVC model. 
In this project Linear SVC, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbour were used and they gave an accuracy
of 97.86%, 90.06% , 94.48%, & 94.25% respectively for open window, which is highly appreciable & nearly same for closed window varying from 2%-4%.
